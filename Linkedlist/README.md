# Linked List

This folder contains the implementation of **Singly Linked List** in Python and related problems.

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a value and a pointer to the next node. It's useful for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions/deletions.

### Key Features:
- Insertion at head, tail, or after a given node
- Deletion by value or position
- Search and length operations
- Iteration and indexing support
