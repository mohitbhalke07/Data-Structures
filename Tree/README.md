# Binary Tree

This folder includes the implementation of a **Binary Tree** and its fundamental traversals.

A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root node and child subtrees. A binary tree allows at most two children for each node.

### Key Features:
- Node-based binary tree implementation
- Inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals
- Basis for binary search trees, heaps, and more
