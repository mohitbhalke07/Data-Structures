# Graph

This folder contains the basic **Graph** implementation using an adjacency list.

Graphs are non-linear data structures consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections). They can be directed/undirected and weighted/unweighted.

### Key Features:
- Vertex and edge addition
- Graph traversal using BFS and DFS
- Adjacency list representation
